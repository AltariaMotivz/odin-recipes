Project: Recipes

Description: Contains a main index page with links to a few of my fave recipes. Not meant to look super pretty, just demonstrate the HTML knowledge I've acquired thus far. Building my HTML chops, going to revisit later to style it up with CSS. 

Reflection: It took some time to set up the list structures from scratch in the first recipe, so I created a template for lists and saved it for future use. I copied the code from the first recipe and used it to save time creating the other two recipe pages. Overall, easy assignment!
